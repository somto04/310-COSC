# SpoilerAlert - A Movie Reviewing Application
COSC-310 Project by CTRL-ALT-DEFEAT

## Description

SpoilerAlert! is a movie review platform built with FastAPI that lets users browse films, read and write reviews, and discover new recommendations. The system includes full user authentication, role-based permissions, movie filtering/search, and community-driven review interactions. It also integrates with the TMDb API to fetch real-time movie details and recommendations.

The backend manages all core logic including reviews, replies, penalties, user accounts, and movie data, while the frontend delivers a clean, responsive UI for both casual users and admins. The platform is designed to be modular, testable, and easy to extend.
