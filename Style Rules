1.	A line should break before the binary operator; improves readability and makes it easier to pick out and prevent errors.
2.	One statement per line; improves readability and makes it easier to pick out and prevent errors.
3.	Comments should be placed on the line before the statement in question; a lot easier to format on the line before rather than inline.
4.	No more than 79 characters per line; means that you won’t have to scroll to see the entire line of code.
    a.	Instead of using backslashes if a line goes over 79 characters, we should use brackets.
5.	Curly braces after a function should be placed on the same line as the function name; this makes the code more compact and gets rid of unnecessary white space.
6.	Use the automatic indentation in python to keep the code uniform.
7.	Use the camel case naming convention for functions and variables.
8.	All constants should be in full caps to differentiate them from variables.
9.	Separating each function with a blank line; makes it easier to collaborate on the code.
10.	When writing functions operators and values should be separated with spaces. E.g. a + b.
11.	When doing selection statements, new if’s and else’s should start on a new line in order to maintain organisation.
12.	Comments should be written on the line before the comment that is being referenced
